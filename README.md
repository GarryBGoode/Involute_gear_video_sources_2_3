Manim Gearbox and Manim CAD drawing utils are plugins I developed for manim. However, I made local modifications to these toolboxes while working on the video sources, without proper branching and maintaining of those projects, because I'm a lazy bastard. So the local versions of those toolboxes are included in this repo.
I intend to merge the new features and bugfixes to the plugins, but I can't promise to make it compatible.

Otherwise the viedo sources are provided as-is.
